Title: Discrete Event Simulation
Description: Discrete event simulation (DES) involves modeling of systems
   having discrete, i.e. abrupt, state changes. For instance, when a job
   arrives to a queue, the queue length abruptly increases by 1.  This
   package is an R implementation of the event-oriented approach to DES;
   see the tutorial in Matloff (2008)
